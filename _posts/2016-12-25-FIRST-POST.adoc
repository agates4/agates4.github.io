*DO IT FOR YOU, IT*

I understand that wasn't clever. But, it rhymes.

And what's the best part about missing the bar in favor of something obviously lesser? You either get to A) use your broken, stress ridden, overconfident yet absurdly insecure bullseye to aim higher next time, or B) explain to everyone involved why the stupid thing you did or said deserves a chance. I could sit here all day and argue the validity of my abhorrently rhymed subtitle and reason with you as to why you should con. Or, I could just.. not. This is one of life's most underrated beauties; confidence in oneself, or, the opportunity to choose what you let bother you, or, the ability to remain strong in the face of challenge. Whatever the moral of this example manifests itself asï’€, THAT is the most underrated of underrated life treasures.
