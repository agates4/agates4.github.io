This visualization shows the relationship between the power and efficiency of cars (through MPG and horsepower) as well as their origin and manufacturer.
As you can see through the graph, the American cars have the highest MPG across the board, as well as the largest horsepower (the size of the boxes).
Japanese cars come second with their horsepower, and European cars come dead last in both power and efficiency.

In this visualization, the cereal manufacturers are lumped together through all their cereals and measured by their cummulative weight and calorie relation. 
The larger the circle, the larger the weight. We can see that manufacturer K and G are very closely tied with weighty and calorie filled cereals,
with P following in 3rd. R Q and N each have similar moderate relative weight / calories, and A is the healthiest and lightest of the manufacturers.

This is a pretty one - we can see that the action subject has the largest outlier in film length, and is also about equal to comedy
in frequency. Drama comes in first place with frequency and length - those films are the longest! Other genres besides action, comedy, and drama appear
far and few between in the 1900s. Drama is the king in this time period - but comedy and action are not that far behind (at least, comparatively
to mystery, science fiction, war, music, horror, and westerns!)

The highest income occupations are the ones in the "other" and "professional" categories with the retired and skilled categories
each having their own outliers. The other category is more sparesly put than the other ones, but we can safely say that
the Clerical, Farm, Laborer, and Military categories are the poorest of the bunch. Also, it seems the payment method doesn't have
a much relationship with the occupation or income level - although one could say that the storecard is mostly used by 
poorer occupations and that debitcard is middleclass = while check is upper middle class and cash peaks the income level charts.

Here we are comparing 1yr and 10yr mutual fund growth. In the 1yr, cumulative growth over the year is much more negatively driven 
in the 1 star category, while 2 stars comes predictably second and 3 third - generally, we can say that the number of stars correlates
with the rate and amount of growth (1 star being the least, 5 stars being the highest). 
As far as 1yr vs 10yr goes - 1 year gains are much higher than 10 year. It seems much more worth to place value in 
large growth / large value mutual funds in a 1 year period than it is in a 10 year period. Predictably, small value and small growth 
drew the worst performance.
